# AI-Based-Yoga-Pose-Recommender
Our project recommends seven tailored asanas based on a user's health conditions. Additionally, our yoga pose estimator detects incorrect postures for improved form. This project fulfills partial requirements for our BE degree in Computer Engineering, completed with my teammates under the guidance of Professor Nabanita Namdal at TSEC.
