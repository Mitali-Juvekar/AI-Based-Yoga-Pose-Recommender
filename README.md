# AI-Based-Yoga-Pose-Recommender
The rising popularity of yoga has sparked an increasing interest among individuals eager to explore its numerous benefits. In response, our project endeavors to develop a system capable of recommending seven authentic yoga asanas tailored to a user's specific chronic health conditions and symptoms. By allowing users to input up to four desired benefits, the system can display relevant yoga poses along with detailed descriptions, ensuring personalized and effective practice. Furthermore, our project includes a yoga pose estimator feature, enabling users to assess their form during exercises. Utilizing this estimator, incorrect postures are promptly detected and signaled to the user, facilitating proper execution for optimal results.

This project represents a significant milestone in our journey towards earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering. It was completed by myself, Mitali Juvekar, and my teammates: Sakshi Bhanage, Shanvi Mehta, and Siddhant Kothari, under the guidance of Professor Nabanita Mandal, Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at TSEC.

Our project entailed developing a user-friendly website where visitors could receive personalized yoga pose recommendations based on their ailments or symptoms. Our goal was to emulate existing yoga websites while integrating a pose estimator for enhanced usability. We prioritized simplicity and ease of use, employing JavaScript, TensorFlow, Python, and MoveNet for backend development, and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React for frontend design.
